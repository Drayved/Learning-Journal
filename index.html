                Hello! This is my learning/coding journey. Hopefully I will keep this site
                updated as I go along. My journey started in April 2022, but to me that was just
                getting my toes wet. I'm on the real journey now.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    Getting started is always one of the hardest parts of any journey.
                    I myself ended up in tutorial hell for a few months, before finding
                    out that I want to be a frontend devloper. Then I came across Scrimba,
                    and here I am.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    I work a remote data entry job. Combine that with coding and 80%
                    of my day is easily typing on the keyboard (and moving the mouse around
                    in circles). A mechanical keyboard is a must! Makes typing much more fun.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    After getting a work from home job, learning to code on the side
                    and then add in some gaming to relax, I learned real quick that
                    I'm going to need a better chair. I personally invested in a Herman
                    Miller Embody.

                <h2 class="blog-title">Distractions</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    One of the reasons I believe people give up on becoming a devloper is distractions.
                    A family is a healthy distraction, and one that requires your attention,
                    but many are just social media, netflix, youtube, video games, etc. I learn I must
                    limit the amount of time I give to these things in a given day.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    One thing I kept hearing in the progamming world is "touch grass".
                    They say that it is a must to take a break and get some fresh air.
                    I've yet to try this. I will let you know how it goes when I do.

                <h2 class="blog-title">When It Works</h2>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    The dopamine hit that I get when my code finally works is far more
                    rewarding than anything I've ever done in a video game. This is one of
                    the things that has kept me going. I'm in such a great mood all day when
                    I finally fix that bug, or I make that website that I've been stuck on.
